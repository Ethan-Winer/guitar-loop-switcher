# DIY Guitar Loop Switcher

## What is a loop switcher?
    A loop switcher is a device that can automatically bypass or enable multiple guitar effect 
	pedals at once. In this case, there are 8 available relays for 8 pedals. There are multiple presets
    activated by the footswitches on the controller. Additionally, there are banks of presets to change
    which ones are immediately available on the controller.


## Things I want to add / change	
    - stronger and more aesthetic enclosures
    - custom PCB instead of prototype boards
    - 7 segment displays for preset and bank information
    - blend circuits controlled by digipots
